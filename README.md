# wireshark-packet-analysis-lab
Packet analysis using Wireshark: filtering, DNS inspection, TCP inspection, and payload analysis.

This project demonstrates how to perform network traffic analysis using Wireshark. It walks through a real-world scenario where a security analyst inspects a packet capture file (`.pcap`) to understand web traffic, DNS queries, and TCP payloads.

## Lab Objectives

- Load and inspect a `.pcap` file using Wireshark
- Apply filters for IP, MAC, DNS, and TCP
- Interpret packet structure: Frame, Ethernet, IP, TCP
- Analyze DNS query/response and TCP payloads

## Tools

- Wireshark
- Sample `.pcap` file (not included)

## Project Files

- `lab_report.md` — Full task-by-task breakdown and answers
- `filters.md` — All filters used with descriptions
- `screenshots/` — Screenshots of key steps (optional)
